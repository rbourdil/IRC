handle _last_ping
	if it is ping (means what?) i think it means it has not received communication 
if it is not ping
	then i check status
for accepting_data
	try making the loop only when you are on the client. 
figure out the difference between delete and killed for the client status
	-how do you kill a client, how do you delete a client

make the receive function to be on the client
